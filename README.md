# VESC-UART-Arduino
In this project, I want to read out telemetry data of the "VESC" speed controller by Benjamin Vedder via UART and display it on an OLED display, connected to an Arduino Nano as a basis for an extended PPM remote control for electric longboards.

The main branch covers a software version for the Arduino Nano with only one serial port and very limited debugging capabilities, as it is small enough to fit into a remote control case. The second branch is for the Arduino Mega with plenty of serial ports and thus sufficient debugging capabilities.

To see the first test of the software go to my YouTube channel... https://youtu.be/-gs7nk1bHng
